<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The best homemade cornbread you'll ever make! The crisp golden crust and moist, fluffy center really can't be beat. If you have some cornmeal sitting in your pantry, cornbread is comfort food just waiting to happen.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 cup yellow cornmeal</li>
    <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1/3 cup neutral oil or melted butter</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Grease a 9-inch round cake pan or cast iron skillet well and set aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.</li>
    <li>In a medium mixing bowl, add the flour, cornmeal, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Whisk to combine well.</li>
    <li>Make a well in the center of your dry ingredients and add your oil or butter, milk, and egg. Stir just until the mixture comes together and there are only a few lumps remaining.</li>
    <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 20-25 minutes until the top is a deep golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
    <li>Serve hot.</li>
