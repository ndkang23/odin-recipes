# odin-recipes

It was the first time building a site on my own. I ran into some challenges with relative links for the images, but found the solution by trying different folders. I accidentally pushed the odin-recipes folder when I should've just pushed the recipes folder. Overall, it was slightly challenging, but I'm glad I got through it.
